# Mindful Twitter
Can't get off Twitter? This add-on will help you reflect on whether you should use Twitter for a few seconds. A very powerful trick that can help you navigate Twitter more wisely.

# Description
The moment you open Twitter, you will see a black overlay asking you to reflect on whether you should open Twitter. After the designated period (now it is 60 seconds), you will continue to navigate to your Twitter session without further interruptions for another 2 minutes.

This is a very early prototype. Future versions will include the options to change all settings including the list of websites other than Twitter.
